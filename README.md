# Multi-index-Search

This search algorithm has an initial number of indexes n = 8.

Further improvements will consists on defining when more, or
less, indexes are required based on size of list and its supporting
data structure. That is, define what factors drive the scalabilty of indexes
to maintian optimal run time speed.

The intent of this search algorithm is to experiment with 
alternate implementations for unorginzed lists.

Algorithmic analysis pending to comfirm actual running time.
Aimiing for O(nlogn).
