# Multi-index-Search

This search algorithm has an initial number of indexes n = 8.

Further improvements will consist of defining when more, or
fewer, indexes are required based on the size of the list and its supporting
data structure. That is, define what factors drive the scalability of indexes
to maintain optimal run time speed.

The intent of this search algorithm is to experiment with 
alternate implementations of search algorithms for unorganized lists.

Algorithmic analysis pending to confirm actual running time.
Aiming for O(nlogn).
